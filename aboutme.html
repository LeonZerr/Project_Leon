          <h2>My way into Muay Thai</h2>
          Hello everyone,
          my name is Leon.  I started to train when I was seventeen years old.
          Eventough I was completly unexpierienced, I instantly falled in
          love with the training and philosophy of the sport. After one year
          of training, I decided to compete and won my first amateur-fight. Within the following two years,
          I fought four more fights. After a two year break during Covid19, I decided to follow my dream.
          In 2022 I traveled to Thailand and successfully gave my Muay Thai debut under professional rules in a local stadium,
          against an experienced fighter (100+ fights) who was 10kg heavier. (pictures and video below)

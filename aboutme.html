          Hello everyone,
          my name is Leon.  I started to train when I was seventeen years old.
          Eventough I was completly unexpierienced, I instantly falled in
          love with the training and philosophy of the sport. After one year
          of training, I decided to compete and won my first amateur-fight. Within the following two years,
          I fought four more fights. After a two year break during Covid19, I decided to follow my dream.
          In 2022 I traveled to Thailand and successfully gave my Muay Thai debut under professional rules in a local stadium,
          against an experienced Fighter (100+ fights) who was 10kg heavier. (video below)
        </p>

          Six months later I started coaching. Until today, I share my knowledge to everyone who wanna learn
          'The Art of Eight Limbs'. All levels are welcome - from beginners to professionals! It doesn't matter whether you wanna 
           fight (amateur to professional) or just wanna gain a healty lifestyle and enjoy learning new skills. Together we can reach 
           your goals! 
        </p>
        <p>
           I am located in Leverkusen (Germany). You can book private or group sessions. Online training is also available.

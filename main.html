        <h1>What is Muay Thai?</h1>
        <p> <SPAN STYLE="font-family:'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'">
          Muay Thai (Thai boxing) is a martial art and combat sport, which dates
          back to the 13th century. Known as the “science of 8 limbs, it
          incorporates strikes using the fists, knees, shins and elbows as well
          as an element of grappling. Muay Thai techniques evolved for use on the battlefields 
          by ancient Thai warriors. With its roots in Thailand’s military, it
          is now trained across the world and numerous organisations broadcast
          Muay Thai ring fighting events to millions of fans globally. It’s also
          a key component of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) styles.

        <h1>What are the benefits of Muay Thai training?</h1>
        <p> <SPAN STYLE="font-family:'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'">
          First of all, everyone can start training Muay Thai. It doesn't matter if you want to compete,
          or just enjoy learning new skills and getting in the best shape of your life.
          Muay Thai isn't just for improving your cardio. It's also much more than a full-body workout. 
          The skills that you learn in Muay Thai classes are also effective for self-defence.

        <h2>The history of Muay Thai</h2>
        <p>
          Muaythai has been a part of Thai history and heritage for hundreds of
          years, as with most traditions from ancient times. Many different
          versions of the history of Muaythai exist, but all sources agree that
          Muaythai was the primary and most effective method of self defence
          used by Thai warriors on the battlefields of conflicts and wars that
          occurred countless times throughout the history of the nation now
          known as Thailand. During this time, a warfare manual named
          “Chupasart” was written. This manual emphasised the martial uses of
          each body part. The underlying philosophy of this manual implied that
          fighting was more than the use of weapons, but most importantly,
          should engage total commitment from mind, body and soul.

        <h2>Traditions in Muay Thai</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Wai Khru Ram Muay:</b> This is a ceremonial dance that fighters
            perform before the fight to show respect to their teachers,
            ancestors, and gods. It also serves as a warm-up and a way to
            display their skills and style.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mongkon:</b> This is a sacred headband that fighters wear before
            the fight, which is believed to bring good luck and protection. It
            is only handled by the fighter and the coach, and it is removed
            before the fight starts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pra Jiad:</b> This is a piece of cloth or rope that fighters tie
            around their arms or waist, which also symbolizes good luck and
            blessing from their family. Some fighters use a piece of their
            mother’s dress for this purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sarama:</b> This is the music that accompanies the fight, which
            consists of four instruments: the Pi Java (clarinet), the Klong Kaak
            (drums), the Ching (cymbals) and the Kong Mong (heavy drum). The
            music matches the tempo and intensity of the fight, and it adds
            excitement and atmosphere to the event.

            Samart Payakaroon is often hailed as one of the greatest Muay Thai
            fighters of all time. He possessed an extremely high fight IQ,
            lightning quick reflexes, and excellent ring vision. Samart also
            fought using creative techniques that were effective and
            unpredictable, even against elite competition in the 80s and 90s
            (dubbed the Golden Age of Muay Thai). There were contests where
            Samart was pushed past the brink of exhaustion, and still gave his
            opponents the fight of their lives. Even in the period where Samart
            was more concerned about his music and acting career, he defeated
            some of the greatest fighters of his generation.
